## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:** Develop a classification model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

**Key Contributions:**

- **Data Preparation:** Executed robust handling of missing values, removal of irrelevant features, and encoding of categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`, `Fare`).
- **Model Implementation:** Utilized `RandomForestClassifier` for predictive modeling.
- **Outcome:** Successfully built a system for survival prediction based on passenger attributes.
